# newtime

A new time.

EDIT: it's done.

Predecessor to `thetime`.

Visit me [here](https://time.okit.works) or [here](https://thetime.pages.dev) (backup).

## Features

- Networked time (synced to the World Time API).
- Themes (dark, light and custom)
- Themes are saved in localStorage
- Minimal interface

## Where are all the 'features'?

To the left of the time, under the toggle.

## OMG EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARED WTH

Move your mouse. Menu options time out after 2.5 seconds.

## To-do

- [ ] Add a new widget interface
- [ ] Add more information via the antenna icon (syncing icon, diff etc.)
